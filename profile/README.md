### History
- [Graph Filter v1.0](https://github.com/GraphFilter/GraphFilter-Deprecated), made with C#, was where it all started. However, now this version is deprecated.  
- [Graph Filter v2.0](https://github.com/GraphFilter/GraphFilter), made with Python, is the improvement of the first version of Graph Filter.
  
For now on, all the updates will be made on the v2.0 repository.
